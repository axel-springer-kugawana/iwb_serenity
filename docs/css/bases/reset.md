## Reset

Reset define default style for primary element to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins, font sizes of headings, and so on.

The serenity reset is based on [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).

Here is a list of some of the major reset that occured:

* Update some browser default values to use rems instead of ems for scalable component spacing.
* The box-sizing is globally set on every elementâ€”including `*::before` and `*::after`, to border-box so that `width` is not affected by `padding` or `border`.
* To avoid margins collapse and a simple mental layout model, the margin-top of most element are reset to 0.
* For easier scaling across device sizes, margins and padding use *rems*.
